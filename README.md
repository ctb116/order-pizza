## Description

_This is an interactive webpage designed to demonstrate my skills using JavaScript Constructors and Prototypes. Users can mock order a pizza by selecting pizza size and toppings._

### Specifications

* _1) Users start on homepage._
* _2) Users click [Start your Order] button to see options for their pizza. Options are:_
  * _Size dropdown form: small, medium, large_
  * _Toppings checkbox form: cheese, pepperoni, artichoke, anchovy_
* _3) Once users have decided on their options, users click [Add to Order] button to see the cost of their selection._

  * _**Example Input: User selects a small pizza with two toppings**_
  * _**Example Output: "$5 for a small pizza and $4 added for 2 toppings"**_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone this repository_
* _Open the Index.html file in Chrome web browser_

_This webpage will likely work as expected in any web browser but specifically was designed for Chrome._

## Known Bugs

* _Users cannot see a total price for the size cost plus the toppings cost of the pizza._
* _Users cannot confirm their order after they see their selection._
